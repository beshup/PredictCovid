Welcome to COVID My Tweets! 

A platform for analyzing and visualizing the sentiment data from tweets based on geographical area.

On the homepage, you may SEARCH for a specific place, it could be a state, province, city, address etc. 
When you are satisfied with your search, press ENTER to select the appropriate heading. (Please do not directly click on the 
pop-up, we can't support this functionallity yet).

After navigating to your desired search in the suggestions and pressing ENTER. A button will appear called "GET DATA".
Upon Selecting this button you can scroll down on the page and view the NLP analysis preformed on tweets from. a variety of
COVID based keywords which were produced with regard to that region. These tweets include the terms "COVID, #socialdistancing" etc.

The "Score" field is the "average overall sentiment" of all tweets about the geographic area which you search for. 
The "Subjectivity" field is how speculative the twees were. I.e. how much we felt their statements were based in fact,
based on NLP analysis.

The remaining fields give percentage break downs of how many of the tweets recieved were positive, negative or neutral.


To navigate to the second page click "DATA HEATMAP BY PROVINCE". Here at the TOP is a button that says Update Database,
this allows us to manually update our database (which takes about 30 mins, completely recalculating the sentiments based on
the latest tweets for each state/province in North America". Otherwise, the database is automatically updated daily.

In here, you may HOVER over top of each province/state to view the "Average Overall Sentiment" for that region. The data is 
also presented in an interactive heat map, where you may click on each desired region to zoom in.

We hope you enjoyed looking around our project!
